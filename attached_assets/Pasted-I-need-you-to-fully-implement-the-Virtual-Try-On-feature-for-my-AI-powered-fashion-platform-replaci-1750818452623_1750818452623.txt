I need you to fully implement the Virtual Try-On feature for my AI-powered fashion platform, replacing the current "coming soon" popup. The platform is React (frontend) + Express (backend) + PostgreSQL with working AI modules (TensorFlow + MediaPipe).

Current Issue:

Clicking "Start Virtual Try-On" shows only a placeholder alert message

Full virtual try-on flow is missing from both frontend and backend

What to Build:

✅ Replace alert with full feature integration:

On click, launch the Virtual Try-On module, providing two options:

Photo Upload Try-On: User uploads image (secure, auto-deletes after processing)

Avatar Try-On: User enters measurements to generate privacy-conscious avatar

Detect body keypoints using MediaPipe

Overlay selected clothing from product catalog onto the photo or avatar

Visualize multiple sizes to assist confident purchase decisions

Ensure rendering completes in under 2 seconds

Responsive design: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile

✅ Backend endpoints (Express API) must:

Receive photo/avatar data securely

Process with MediaPipe for pose estimation

Handle garment overlay logic

Return try-on result image or error gracefully

✅ Frontend (React) must:

Launch a modal or full-screen try-on interface

Provide intuitive step-by-step flow for photo upload or avatar creation

Display try-on result, allow size selection visualization

Handle errors clearly if try-on fails

Additional Requirements:

Privacy: Auto-delete uploaded photos unless explicit consent to save

Maintain performance: API response under 500ms, rendering under 2s

Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all try-on interfaces

Keep existing recommendation engine and product catalog fully functional

Environment:

React + Express (already deployed)

MediaPipe, TensorFlow AI stack already integrated

PostgreSQL database with products and user profiles in place

Deliverables:

Fully working, production-ready Virtual Try-On feature

No placeholder alerts; complete user-facing functionality

Updated React components and backend API routes

Documentation update for new feature

This feature is critical for my academic project and live demo. Focus on production quality, privacy compliance, and smooth UX.
